# rBikeLA

Scripts to get an updated [bike tag](https://www.reddit.com/r/BikeLA/wiki/phototag) leaderboard and found tags list from [/r/bikeLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/BikeLA).

## Installation
You will need **Python 3** installed.

Clone this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:ashleyshine/rBikeLA.git
cd rBikeLA
```

If you want to use a virtual environment (recommended):
```
pip3 install -U pip
python3 -m venv rbikela_env
source rbikela_env/bin/activate
```

Install required packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Adding a Reddit Developer Token
In order to interface with reddit using its [API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), you will need to authenticate with OAuth2. Follow the this [quick start example](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps) to create an app. You will need your client ID and secret.

Once you've created an app, create a `config/` directory and add your client ID, client secret, and user agent (reddit username) in JSON format to a file called `client` in the directory.
```
mkdir config
cd config
touch client
```
The contents of the `client` file should look like:
```
{"client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>", "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>", "user_agent": "<USERNAME>"}
```

## Usage
To generate the bike tag leaderboard, call the `get_leaderboard.py` script. There are a few options you can configure.
```
~/Projects/rBikeLA (master) ‚ùØ python3 ./scripts/get_leaderboard.py --help
usage: get_leaderboard.py [-h] --current_tag CURRENT_TAG
                          [--n_leaderboard N_LEADERBOARD]
                          [--use_wiki USE_WIKI] [--qa QA]

Get updated r/bikeLA bike tag leaderboard.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --current_tag CURRENT_TAG, -c CURRENT_TAG
                        Current tag in r/bikeLA
  --n_leaderboard N_LEADERBOARD, -n N_LEADERBOARD
                        Length of leaderboard to output (top N by rank)
  --use_wiki USE_WIKI, -u USE_WIKI
                        Read tags from wiki. If False, start processing posts
                        from Tag #1
  --qa QA, -q QA        Print QA report
```

By default, tags already listed on the leaderboard wiki will be used unless `--use_wiki False` is passed.

### Example
The following call will print an updated leaderboard and found tags list up to tag #392. The leaderboard and found tags list are formatted in Markdown, so they can be directly copy & pasted into the phototag wiki.
```
./scripts/get_leaderboard.py -c 392 -q True
```
Example output:
```

It will also print a QA report, which can be used to check for missing tags.
```

```

### Manual Overrides
If multiple posts are found for a bike tag or no post is found for a bike tag, you will see messages like this:
```
WARNING: No posts found for #290. Skipping.Please find post manually and add to resource directory.

WARNING: More than one post found for #341. Skipping. Please resolve manually and add to resource directory.
Tag posts: ['Bike Tag #341', 'Bike Tag #341']
```
You can manually look up the tag post in [/r/bikeLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/BikeLA/) and add them to the `resources` directory in JSON format, with one tag per line. If a manual override exists for a tag, it will always be preferred when retrieving new tag info.
